# We need to import the function to be tested.
# The Evaluator will likely execute the evolved code in a way that makes this function
# available in the testing scope, or it might dynamically import the evolved module.
# For now, to make these tests runnable standalone (e.g., if you copy
# initial_code.py to this directory or adjust PYTHONPATH), we can try a relative import.
# However, the primary way these tests will be used is by the Evaluator, which will
# handle making the 'target_function_to_optimize' available.

# If initial_code.py is in the same directory:
# from .initial_code import target_function_to_optimize
# For now, let's assume the Evaluator will make it available in the global scope
# or handle the import dynamically. If running pytest directly on this file,
# you might need to ensure initial_code.py is discoverable.

# A more robust way for standalone pytest runs from project root, assuming
# the function is in evocoder.problems.simple_line_reducer.initial_code
